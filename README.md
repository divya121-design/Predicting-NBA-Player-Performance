# Predicting-NBA-Player-Performance

## Abstract

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the performance of NBA players based on historical statistical data. By analyzing key factors such as points per game, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, shooting percentages, minutes played, and player efficiency rating (PER), the model aims to provide insights into player performance trends and forecast future performance.


## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the performance of NBA players based on various statistical factors.

## Tools

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (for code documentation and analysis)
- Git (version control)
